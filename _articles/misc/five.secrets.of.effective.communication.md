## E = Empathy

1. The **Disarming Technique** (DT). Find some truth in what the other person
   is saying, even if it seems totally unreasonable or unfair.
2. **Empathy**. Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to see the
   world through his or her eyes.  
   - *Thought Empathy* (TE). Paraphrase the other person's words.  
   - *Feeling Empathy* (FE). Acknowledge how the other person is probably feeling, based on what she or he said.
3. **Inquiry** (IN). Ask gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the
   other person is thinking and feeling.

## A = Assertiveness

4. **"I Feel"** Statements (IF). Express your own ideas and feelings in a
   direct, tactful manner. Use "I feel" statements, such as "I feel upset,"
   rather than "you" statements, such as "You're wrong!" or "You're making me
   furious!"
   - Don't do mind reading, don't do fortune telling
   - **be true to yourself**

## R = Respect

5. **Stroking** (ST). Convey an attitude of respect, even if you feel
   frustrated or angry with the other person. Find something genuinely positive
   to say to the other person, even in the heat of battle.

## Mutually Acceptable Resolution

- come to a point where you can propose & counter-propose
